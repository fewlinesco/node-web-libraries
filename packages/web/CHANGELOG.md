# CHANGELOG

## 2.0.3 - 2020-07-27

- The `createApp` router argument is now typed as `Router`.

## 2.0.2 - 2020-06-30

- Fixed custom router's `delete` method to call the right express method.

## 2.0.1 - 2020-06-17

- Added `traceid` to the logs generated by the logging middleware.

## 2.0.0 - 2020-05-13

- Removed `Params` from the exported types of Router.
- Separated Query String and Named Parameters from the Body (hence a "GET" handler has a different signature).
- Routes must now type what they will receive as params (one type for "GET" routes, two types for the others).

## 1.0.0 - 2020-04-16

- Created the package @fewlines/fwl-web:
  - Router
  - Logging Middleware
  - Http Statuses
  - Errors
