# CHANGELOG

## 0.4.0 - 2020-08-11

- `createApp` now requires a `Router[]` argument instead of a `Router`

## 0.3.0 - 2020-08-06

- Fix: Router Types were not exported correctly

## 0.2.0 - 2020-08-04

- `ResolveFunction` now accept 4 arguments: an HTTP status code, some data, a headers object and options.
  - This allows for redirects using 301, 302, 307 or 308 status code with the redirect URI as the second parameter.
  - This allows for sending files by setting `{ file: true }` as the options fourth argument.
- `router.get` can now be used without a Generic Type if you have no Query Parameter to deal with (or with `router.get<EmptyParams>`).
- A route with POST, PATCH, PUT or DELETE can use `EmptyBody` as its second Generic if you have no Body.

## 0.1.0 - 2020-08-03

- Package renamed from `@fewlines/fwl-web` to `@fwl/web`.
- `UnamangedError` takes an `Error` as first argument to be able to display the error mesage in the logging middleware.
- `NotFoundError` and `BadRequestError` takes an option `Error` second argument to display the error message in the logging middleware.

## 2.0.3 - 2020-07-27

- The `createApp` router argument is now typed as `Router`.
- `GetUsersByIdParams` has been temporary typed as `any` to prevent `ESLint` error.

## 2.0.2 - 2020-06-30

- Fixed custom router's `delete` method to call the right express method.

## 2.0.1 - 2020-06-17

- Added `traceid` to the logs generated by the logging middleware.

## 2.0.0 - 2020-05-13

- Removed `Params` from the exported types of Router.
- Separated Query String and Named Parameters from the Body (hence a "GET" handler has a different signature).
- Routes must now type what they will receive as params (one type for "GET" routes, two types for the others).

## 1.0.0 - 2020-04-16

- Created the package @fewlines/fwl-web:
  - Router
  - Logging Middleware
  - Http Statuses
  - Errors
