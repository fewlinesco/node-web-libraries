# FWL Tracing

**Disclaimer**: this package is made for our internal usage and is only open source for convenience so we might not consider Pull Requests or Issues. Feel free to fork though.

This is part of the Fewlines Web Libraries packages.
It provides a simple way to do tracing with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io).

## Installation

```shell
yarn add @fwl/tracing
```

## Getting Started

As OpenTelemetry libraries need to monkey patch packages before them being called, the easiest way is to initialize tracing in a separate file that is required using nodeâ€™s (or ts-node's) -r option before application code runs.

So for instance, have a `tracing.ts` file with that content:

```typescript
// src/tracing.ts
import { startTracer } from "@fwl/tracing";

startTracer({ serviceName: "serviceName" });
```

And start your server with `ts-node -r src/tracing.ts src/index.ts`.

Once you're done, your `index.ts` could get the Tracer with:

```typescript
import { getTracer } from "@fwl/tracing";

const tracer = getTracer();
```

## Usage

Once you have a tracer (of type `Tracer`), you will have a `span` method:

```typescript
import { Span, Tracer } from "@fwl/tracing";

// ...
function(tracer: Tracer) {
  tracer.span("span name", async (span: Span) => {
    // If you want to add attributes to your span
    span.setAttribute(key, value);

    // any code there that return a Promise (in this example, the callback is an `async` function so any value should do
  });
}
```

This way is the recommended way as it will automatically end the span for you.
However, if you ever are in need to more fine grain control (for instance, in a middleware), you can use `createSpan`:

Here is an example of a logging middleware:

```typescript
import { NextFunction, Request, Response } from "express";
import { Logger } from "@fwl/logging";
import { Tracer, Span } from "@fwl/tracing";

export function loggingMiddleware(tracer: Tracer, logger: Logger) {
  function onCloseOrFinish(span: Span, startTime: bigint): () => void {
    return function () {
      const response = this as Response;
      response.removeListener("finish", onCloseOrFinish);
      const end = process.hrtime.bigint();
      logger.log(
        `${response.req.path}: ${response.statusCode} in ${end - startTime}`,
      );
      span.end();
    };
  }
  return function (
    _request: Request,
    response: Response,
    next: NextFunction,
  ): void {
    const startTime = process.hrtime.bigint();
    const span = tracer.createSpan("logging middleware");
    response.once("finish", onCloseOrFinish(span, startTime));
    next();
  };
}
```

Keep in mind that this method is only required because we need to call `next()` and we want to start the span across the whole request.
The recommended method is to use `tracer.span`.

## Tracing during tests

If you need to use the tracer in a testing environment, we provide a `InMemoryTracer` class that act as a regular tracer, expect you won't have to launch `jaeger` to run your tests.`InMemoryTracer` also provides you with a way of testing your spans with the use of the `searchSpanByName` The usage is the same, you just need to initialize `InMemoryTracer` instead of using `startTracer()`.

Here is an example of use in a test file using `jest`:

```ts
import { InMemoryTracer } from "../inMemoryTracer";

describe("InMemoryTracer:", () => {
  let tracer: InMemoryTracer;

  const spanNames = ["first-span", "second-span", "third-span", "second-span"];

  beforeEach(() => {
    tracer = new InMemoryTracer();
  });

  describe("searchSpanByName function:", () => {
    test("it should return all the span named as the argument", async (done) => {
      expect.assertions(3);

      for await (const spanName of spanNames) {
        await tracer.span(spanName, async (span) => span);
      }

      const spans = tracer.searchSpanByName("second-span");

      expect(spans.length).toEqual(2);

      spans.forEach((span) => {
        expect(span.name).toBe("second-span");
      });

      done();
    });
  });
});
```
